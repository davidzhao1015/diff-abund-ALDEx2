# Differential abundance of taxa analysis for compositional microbiome data using ALDEx2
The repository demonstrates the R pipeline for compositional analysis of microbiome data with ALDEx2 R package. The microbiome data set and assocaited metadata used in the repository originated from a Nature paper, "A core gut microbiome in obese and lean twins" (2019) by Jeffrey I Gordon et. al.. I retrieved all the input data from Microbiome Learning Repo (ML Repo) (https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/docs/turnbaugh_lean_obese_all.html) developed by Dr. Dan Knights and colleagues.
